===========================================================

New in 17.0.0:

chan_sip:
 - The chan_sip module is now deprecated, users should migrate to the
   replacement module chan_pjsip.  See guides at the Asterisk Wiki:
     https://wiki.asterisk.org/wiki/x/tAHOAQ
     https://wiki.asterisk.org/wiki/x/hYCLAQ

func_callerid:
 - The CALLERPRES() dialplan function, deprecated in Asterisk 1.8, has been
   removed.

res_parking:
 - The PARKINGSLOT channel variable, deprecated in Asterisk 12 in favor of the
   PARKING_SPACE channel variable, will no longer be set.

res_xmpp:
 - The JabberStatus application, deprecated in Asterisk 12, has been removed.

Channels:
 - The core no longer uses the stasis cache for channels snapshots.
   The following APIs are no longer available:
       ast_channel_topic_cached()
       ast_channel_topic_all_cached()
   The ast_channel_cache_all() and ast_channel_cache_by_name() functions
   now returns an ao2_container of ast_channel_snapshots rather than a
   container of stasis_messages therefore you can't call stasis_cache
   functions on it.
   The ast_channel_topic_all() function now returns a normal topic,
   not a cached one so you can't use stasis cache functions on it either.
   The ast_channel_snapshot_type() stasis message now has the
   ast_channel_snapshot_update structure as it's data.
   ast_channel_snapshot_get_latest() still returns the latest snapshot.

Applications
 - The JabberStatus application, deprecated in Asterisk 12, has been removed.

Bridging
 - The bridging core no longer uses the stasis cache for bridge
   snapshots.  The latest bridge snapshot is now stored on the
   ast_bridge structure itself.
 - The following APIs are no longer available since the stasis cache
   is no longer used:
     ast_bridge_topic_cached()
     ast_bridge_topic_all_cached()
 - A topic pool is now used for individual bridge topics.
 - The ast_bridge_cache() function was removed since there's no
   longer a separate container of snapshots.
 - A new function "ast_bridges()" was created to retrieve the
   container of all bridges.  Users formerly calling
   ast_bridge_cache() can use the new function to iterate over
   bridges and retrieve the latest snapshot directly from the
   bridge.
 - The ast_bridge_snapshot_get_latest() function was renamed to
   ast_bridge_get_snapshot_by_uniqueid().
 - A new function "ast_bridge_get_snapshot()" was created to retrieve
   the bridge snapshot directly from the bridge structure.
 - The ast_bridge_topic_all() function now returns a normal topic
   not a cached one so you can't use stasis cache functions on it
   either.
 - The ast_bridge_snapshot_type() stasis message now has the
   ast_bridge_snapshot_update structure as it's data.  It contains
   the last snapshot and the new one.
